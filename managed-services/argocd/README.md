ArgoCD facilitates the management of Kubernetes applications in a GitOps manner. It allows you to declaratively define, maintain, and update applications using Git repositories as the source of truth.

For any modifications or customizations, edit the `values.yaml` file or create a Kubernetes manifest file.
